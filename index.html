    <h1> Displaying Distributions</h1>
<p>
    A distribution is a collection of data comfigured into data set. There are 4 defining elements that affect the visual appearance of a distribution: level, spread, shape, and outliers. Level is the measures of central tendency, such as mean, median, and mode. The spread in data is the measure of how far the numbers in a data set are away from the mean or the median. Spread can also tell how much variation there is between the highest and lowest values in the set. The shape of a distribution is the visual representation of a data set. Outliers are values that are an abnormal distance away from other values. All of these are elements that define a data distribution.

    All of the elements of a distribution can have large impacts on the visual illustration of the distribution itself. The level shows how the majority of the data is assembled, such as mean, median, and mode. The spread can possibly include outliers, which can affect the measures of central tendency. The shape of the distribution is the key element of its visual appearance. Shape gives the initial impact of the distribution because people see the shape of a data set before they read the actual data. Outliers impact the visual appearance of a distribution the most because they affect almost all of the other elements and can completely change how a data distribution would look without them. All in all, distributions are complex illustrations of data that can be easily described by multiple different elements.
